## **Hi there! Welcome to my Github.**

My name is Gabriel Pacheco, and I'm a Data Scientist from Brazil! 
I love games, music, movies, books, lists, and jokes!!! (there goes a joke for you)

You can reach me at: gasp37@hotmail.com
or my [LinkedIn.](linkedin.com/in/gabriel-pacheco37/)

Some tools that I use are:

- Python and it's data related libraries
- MySQL, PostgreSQL and NoSQL (MongoDB)
- Apache Spark
- Google Cloud Platform
- DataViz tools (PowerBI, Looker, Metabase)

There's more but those are the ones I use the most.

Currently, I'm focused on learning more about Machine Learning (human learning machine learning, yeah i know the irony)

Down below you can find some of my projects. ðŸ‘‡
